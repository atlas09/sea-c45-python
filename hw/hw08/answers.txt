Homework 8

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296

Problem 3:

When “seq = ‘’” and “linenum = 0” are commented out, a NameError is thrown for linenum, because when “linenum = linenum + 1” is called the program doesn’t know what type and value linenum is. 

When “gc_count = 0” is commented out, a NameError also occurs.

Problem 6:

sanityCheck (which returns whether the total_count, len(seq), and the sum of G, C, A, T counts are equal) failed for test-high-gc-1.fastq where the GCAT individual sum equaled 39840 whilst total_count and len(seq) equaled 4000.

After looking at the sequence in test-high-gc-1.fastq, I saw some characters that were not G, C, A, T— most N’s.

So I added an else statement that incremented the variable not_gcat and added it to the gcatx_sum, where x are characters not G, C, A, or T.
